# Image_Text_Detection_Recognition_Translation

Your README file is normally the first entry point to your code. It should tell people why they should use your module, how they can install it, and how they can use it. Standardizing how you write your README makes creating and maintaining your READMEs easier. Great documentation takes work!

This repository contains:

1. A Jupyter Notebook for detecting and recognizing texts in images. The image detector is built using [EAST: An Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03155) and the text recognizer is built using a [CRNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.05717).
2. Second Jupyter Notebook for Translating text from hindi to english using an [Encoder-Decoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473).

## USAGE
For using the notebooks open both the notebooks in **Google Colab**.
